Turn the fillet over, skin-side up, and make 2 to 3 slits into the skin, about 1/2 inch deep and 1-inch long.Lay each piece of salmon, skin-side down, on its own piece of plastic wrap. Squirt the juice from half of the lemon on the salmon.In a medium bowl, combine the salt, sugar, and dill. Pile the mixture on top of the salmon fillets, using all of it.Wrap each piece of salmon tightly in the plastic wrap and stack them in a pan. I like to use a bread pan because it takes up less space in my fridge. Put another pan of equal size on top of the salmon, then put something in the top pan to weigh it down — like a few cans of coconut milk.Refrigerate for 2–3 days until the salmon has become more firm and slices thinly very easily. It should have a deep salty, dilly taste. If you need to, rinse any remaining salt left on the salmon before serving.,_Appetizer,Chicken,Sweet,Sour,Entree
