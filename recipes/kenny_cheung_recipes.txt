Homemade Gravlax,_http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/appetizers-and-snacks/homemade-gravlax/,_appetizer,_Note: Prep time does not include 2 to 3 days curing time.From Natalie Perry of Perry’s Plate.,_10,_minutes,_5,_minutes,_6+,_intermediate,_3,_pound(s),_Skin-on Salmon Fillets Of Fairly Even Thickness, Either One Large Or A Few Smaller Ones,_1,_pcs,_Lemon,_2,_cup,_Kosher Salt,_2,_teaspoon,_Sugar,_1,_cup,_Fresh Chopped Dill,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_If you are using 1 large fillet, cut it in half. Turn the fillet over, skin-side up, and make 2 to 3 slits into the skin, about 1/2 inch deep and 1-inch long.Lay each piece of salmon, skin-side down, on its own piece of plastic wrap. Squirt the juice from half of the lemon on the salmon.In a medium bowl, combine the salt, sugar, and dill. Pile the mixture on top of the salmon fillets, using all of it.Wrap each piece of salmon tightly in the plastic wrap and stack them in a pan. I like to use a bread pan because it takes up less space in my fridge. Put another pan of equal size on top of the salmon, then put something in the top pan to weigh it down — like a few cans of coconut milk.Refrigerate for 2–3 days until the salmon has become more firm and slices thinly very easily. It should have a deep salty, dilly taste. If you need to, rinse any remaining salt left on the salmon before serving.,_Appetizer,Chicken,Sweet,Sour,Entree

Light and Healthy Tuna Salad,_http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/appetizers-and-snacks/light-and-healthy-tuna-salad/,_appetizer,_This light and healthy tuna salad is great for a sandwich, top it on a cracker or a bell pepper slice, wrap it in a tortilla, or wrap it in a lettuce leaf.,_20,_minutes,_10,_minutes,_6+,_easy,_2,_pcs,_whole Hard Boiled Eggs,_2,_,_can (5 Oz. Size) Albacore Tuna (WildPlanet),_1,_cup,_Yellow Onion, Chopped,_0.7,_cup,_Celery, Chopped,_1,_spoon,_Lemon Juice (or ,_2,_spoon,_Fresh Parsley (or 1 Tablespoon Dried),_10,_spoon,_Mayonnaise,_1,_teaspoon,_Kosher Salt,_0.5,_teaspoon,_Black Pepper,_,_,_,_Chop hard boiled eggs in a large bowl. If using WildPlanet brand tuna, drain one can of tuna, but not the other. WildPlanet tuna is not packed in water or oil, the liquid is just part of the fish. If you’re using some other brand packed in oil or water, drain both cans and do not use any of the liquid. Don’t panic, it will still taste fine without it.Break up the tuna and add it along with all the other ingredients and stir until mixed. Do not stir until it’s mush. It should be somewhat chunky and not goopy.I like this on a croissant. Or place some on a piece of multi-grain bread, top it with a slice of your favorite cheese and toast it and another piece of bread open faced in a toaster oven. Assemble and rejoice in the pleasure of the best tuna sandwich you’ve ever eaten. Other options are to put it onto your favorite buttery cracker for a light snack or wrap it in a tortilla or lettuce leaf.,_Appetizer,Snacks
